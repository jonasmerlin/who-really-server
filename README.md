# who-really-server

The API server for Who Really?!

The master branch is automatically deployed to Heroku under who-really.herokuapp.com

## Running locally

If you want to run the server locally, do the following:

Clone the repo and checkout the `local` branch.

Then run

```sh
make prepare
make serve
```

The server should now run on your machine and tell you where you can reach it.
